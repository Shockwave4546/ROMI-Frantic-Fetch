# ROMI - Frantic Fetch Challenge Code

Based on the example Ramsette Command/Trajectory code.  Attempted to try to make the tracjectory driving to work but not enough time to dial down the tunings and get things to actually work.

Drifty Gyro and lots of Slippages on the wheels on top of robot trends to drive to one side - motor differences and all that...
